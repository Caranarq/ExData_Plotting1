# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Course Project 1

Good day fellow student who is evaluating my assignment.
As requested in the assignment, I included 4 .PNG files containing the graphs and 4 .R files containing the code.

If you are familiar with Knitr, you can save you time and instead of opening 4 files, just open the EDA_CP1.Rmd file or the EDA_CP1.html with all the code and graphs.

Have a nice day.
